This repository aims to use the graph logic which I have previously created in the graph.py files to create the dijkstra algorithm which finds the shortest path between a vertex and any/all other vertices in the graph. Additionally it also looks at A* search - which will not always find the shortest path but will find an adequate option and is significantly faster than dijkstra. It is however very reliant on the heuristic function. A poor heuristic will make the algorithm incredibly slow.
